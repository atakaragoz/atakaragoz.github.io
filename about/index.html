	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
  <p> I am really interested in spatial navigation, cognitive maps, programming, reinforcement learning, and more recently event segmentation.
  I graduated with a B.S. in Neuroscience from the University of Texas at Austin in Spring of 2018. In August I will be a PhD student in Psychological and Brain Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis 
in Dr. Zachariah Reagh's lab!
