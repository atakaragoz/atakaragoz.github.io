	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
  <p> I am really interested in spatial navigation, cognitive maps, programming, and more recently reinforcement learning.
  I graduated with a B.S. in Neuroscience from the University of Texas at Austin in Spring of 2018. I am currently preparing to apply for PhD
  programs in Cognitive Neuroscience or Psychology.
