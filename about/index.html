	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
  <p> I am really interested in knowledge structures, narratives, programming, reinforcement learning, and more recently, aging.

  I graduated with a B.S. in Neuroscience from the University of Texas at Austin in Spring of 2018. I am now a second year in the <a href="https://sites.wustl.edu/complexmemlab/">Complex Memory Lab</a> working under Dr. Zach Reagh.
