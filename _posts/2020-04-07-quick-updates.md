This year I was grateful to receive offers from fantastic programs with great mentors. This was such a shock to someone with chronically low self-esteem. In the end I have chosen to go to Washington University in St. Louis to start a new lab with a fantastic team. I am really excited for what the future holds. 

It is, however, fairly odd to be excited about the prospects of moving and starting study when something as surreal as a worldwide pandemic is occuring keeping us all penned in our homes. 

March and so far April have been such an odd mix of heartbreaking and reinvigorating. 

I am so excited for the next steps even though they may be unsteady now because of a virus.
